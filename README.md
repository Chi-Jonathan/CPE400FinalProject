# CPE400FinalProject

## Prompt
The team will simulate a mesh network where nodes and links may fail. Nodes and links may fail intermittently, as an input to the simulation, each node and link will have a certain probability to fail. When such failure occurs, the network must adapt and re-route to avoid the faulty link/node.

## Required Resources
Python3

## To Run from Terminal
CD in to the project directory and run the command 

python3 main.py

in the terminal to run the simulation. The user should expect to see prompts to input a start node, end node, and probability for failure.

## Contributions
Jessica Nam - Created the functionalities to simulate failures and depth first search.
Jonathan Chi - Created the functionalities for Dijkstra's algorithm and user input.
Both members worked on debugging and the project document together.
